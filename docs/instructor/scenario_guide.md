2. On the `Scenarios` page click the `New Scenario` button. This will take you to a scenario creation page. On this page you can enter a name for your scenario, and select a group to add to the scenario using the droup down menu. To submit the scenario for creation, select the type of scenario you would like to create from the table.

3. Creating a scenario will redirect you back to the `Scenarios` page where you should now be able to see you scenario on the table. You will have control options for starting, stopping, and destroying the scenario. The listed name of the scenario will also act as a button which will take you to a page with more information about the scenario.

It should be noted that currently students who are added to groups after the creation of a scenario for that group, will not be able to access the scenario. To allow late students to access a group scenario, you can destroy the scenario and create it again for the group to automatically add new students to the scenario.
