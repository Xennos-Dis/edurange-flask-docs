## Student Groups Guide

This guide is a step by step walkthrough for instructors on creating and managing student groups.

1. On your Admin Dashboard, in the `Create Student Group` box input a group name. If you would like student accounts for the group to be automatically generated tick the checkbox next to the `Create` button and input the number of student accounts you would like the group to have. Finally, click the `Create` button to create the group.

2. Once the group is created a tab with the name of your group will appear in the `All Groups` box. Clicking this tab will show you a table of all the student accounts in this group, as well as the group **Registration Code**. This code can be given to students before they have made their accounts so that their accounts are automatically added to your group.

3. Alternatively, if your students already have accounts, you can go to the `Manage Students` box and manually add students to your group. This can be done by selecting your group using the drop down menu and then selecting the studetns from the table using the selection buttons. Changes are submitted by pressing the `Add Students to Group` button. This panel also allows you to remove students from a group, by the same process, except the submission is made using the `Remove Students from Group` button
