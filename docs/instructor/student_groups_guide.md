This guide is a step by step walkthrough for instructors on creating and managing student groups.

 1. On your Admin Dashboard, in the `Create Student Group` box input a group name and press the `Create` button.

 2. A registration code for this group can be aquired by going to the dop down menu by your username in the upper right hand corner of the page and selecting *`Instructor View`*. You can now go to the Instructor Dashboard on the sidebar and find your group and its code on the Owned Groups table. This registration code can be given to students before they register their accounts so that they automatically join your group.

 3. Alternatively, if your students already have accounts, you can go to the Manage Students table on your Admin Dashboard and select students who you wish to add to your group. This is also where you can remove students from a group. Selections can be made by pressing the buttons in the selection column, or by entering the student ids as a list in the search bar for example:	`[2, 3, 4]`
 A specific group can be selected using the drop down menu next to the selection submission buttons. A selection can be submitted by pressing the `Add Selected To` button or the `Remove Selected From` button.
