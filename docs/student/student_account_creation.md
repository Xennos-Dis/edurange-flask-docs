 2. On the Registration page, enter your username and password, as well as a valid email address. If your instructor has given you a registration code, you should enter it on this page. When you have finished entering your information, click the `Register` button to create your account. You should be redirected back to the Home page.

 3. You can login by entering your username and password in their respective fields on the navigation bar at the top of the page and clicking the `Login` button.
 
 If you created your account and logged in correctly, then you should be able to see a *`Dashboard`* option on your sidebar, which can be shown or hidden by clicking the `Navigate` button on the navigation bar at the upper left hand corner of the page.
