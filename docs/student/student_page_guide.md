## Student Page Guide

This is a reference guide of the pages accessible to students.


Students have access to their own student `Dashboard`, which is always accessible via the collapsible sidebar. The dasboard gives the student access to three tables. The `User Info` table, the `Member of Groups` table, and the `Scenarios` table.

The `Scenarios` table shows all of the scenarios that a student is a part of. The table displays the name and type of scenario, as well as the related group and instructor. The listed name for each scenario acts as a button which sends the user to the scenario information page.

The scenario information page, is accessible via the listed name of any scenario in the students `Scenarios` table. Each scenario information page has important information about the selected scenario, including ssh information. This is also the page where students will be able to submit responses to questions about the scenario.
